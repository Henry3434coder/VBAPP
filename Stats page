#The passing stats page is a classic report page.
#sql query for this report page is:

 SELECT

    p.POSITION,
    p.CLASS,
    p.JERSEY_NUMBER,
    ps.IN_SYSTEM_PASSES,

#joins the two tables based on playerID.
#Withouth the Case part of the query Apex will through an error because of the null value in the passing column. 
#EX before any data is entered for a player it will be 0.

#2 other columns are created in the query. percent good and percent bad.
#these jsut exist in the query and are not stored in a table. The numbers will be produced from the pdf export.


#The next most important thing to do is to create a page item. 
#This will be a hidden page item and its purpose is to store the ID of the row, in order to insert data.

#The next important step is to create buttons for inserting data. You will need to create plan text columns with HTML expresssions for the buttons.
#both buttons have a data task id, and a cc. 
#The task id allow the button to grab the ID of the player for the specific row and the cc if for storing the function of the button.
#cc for the first is delete because it came from a test ignore it.

#button one insystem passes
<button type="button" data-task-id="#PLAYER_ID#"
class="t-Button t-Button--hot cc-delete-btn">INSYSPASS</button>


#button 2 outsystem passes
<button type="button" data-pask-id="#PLAYER_ID#" 
class="t-Button t-Button--hot t-Button--danger cc-outsys-btn">OUTSYSPASS</button>


#both buttons have functions that allow them to work I will go through that now.

#starting with Insystem passes.
# go to dy
